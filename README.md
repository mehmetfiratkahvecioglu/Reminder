# ToDoList
It is a three-paged to-do list mobile app for iOS that is similar to Apple's native Reminder app.
It has two screens. The first one is the list screen includes to-dos with their description, date, and time. Each todo can be deleted by swiping left and each to-do has a check button to make it completed.
By tapping the plus(create) button, the create to-do screen opens. Users can define a description, date, and time on the to-do. A create button provides saving the to-do and it will be seen in the list on the list screen.
In case the user taps on one of the to-dosâ€™s info button, the detail page shows, and the user can edit the to-do.
